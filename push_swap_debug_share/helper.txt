set positions. make a boolean that is also true or false if it is below
or above the median.


function Target node.

target node is responsible for settings the "target Node" varialbe inside of the
t_node.
because all numbers are pushed to b. It is responsible for setting the smalles number
in stack A that is still larger than the number being compared to
Input:

    Stack A (head_a): 5 → 4 → 1

    Stack B (head_b): 3 → 2 → 9 → 10 → 7 → 6 → 8

Process Each Node in Stack B:

    Node 3 from Stack B:

        Compare with nodes in Stack A:

            3 < 5: True → Candidate target = 5.

            3 < 4: True → Candidate target = 4.

            3 < 1: False → Skip.

        Best target: Node with value 4.
If it finds no value, then assign the smallest node to it, as if the stackA (head_a) = 100
and the smallest number is 1. thats good. As if the number 100 is pushed before 1. Its
still in order.

calculate_push_price

Simply calculates the price of getting the "target" and the current_node to the top
of their stacks. This simplifies the logic a bit, because we can calculate that it
always takes 2 more rotations to get them in the correct position. This does However
give all numbers a cost at the same time. Instead of finding a possible number, then
simulating it one by one.
1. Node 3 (B)

    Target in A: Node 4

    Current Position (B): 0 (top of B)

    B Rotation Cost:

        above_median = true (position ≤ 3.5; 0 ≤ 3)

        Cost = 0 (no rotations needed to bring 3 to top)

    A Rotation Cost:

        Target node 4 is at position 1 in A (median = 1.5)

        above_median = true (1 ≤ 1.5)

        Cost = 1 (rotate A once to bring 4 to top)

    Total Push Price: 0 + 1 = 1

Set cheapest is simple. It will traverse the stack passed into it, and then set the node
with the cheapest push price to "true".
-- for now, we will keep it that it does not compare equal push prices, and simply takes
the first cheapest. If node 1 & 2 have push price 1. Node 1 will reimain cheapest
